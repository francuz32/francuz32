- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @francuz32
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding, sports, languages, and education. I love learning and teaching!
- ðŸŒ± Full-Stack dev, knowledge in html, css, javascript, java, and sql. 
- Sadly, I haven't had any formal work experience yet. I'm constantly practicing and learning new things to be able to reach that goal. I understand that having a formal job is essential to learn a lot of necessary skills in coding so that's my goal now.
- ðŸ“« You can always send me an email to franc.uribez@gmail.com in case you want to ask me anything =)
